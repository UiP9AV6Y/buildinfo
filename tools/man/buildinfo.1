.PP
\fIbuildinfo\fP \- utility to generate build information suitable for embedding in code.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fIbuildinfo\fP \fB[OPTION]\fP...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Applications usually expose their version information in one way or another.
Up until this point, in the context of Golang, this information was embedded into
the compiled artifact via linker flags during building. The actual information
was calculated via a series of (shell\-) commands. Since all of this requires
orchestration, this was usually done using some kind of build system (Make, Bazel, ...)

.PP
\fB\fCbuildinfo\fR aims to remove all that cruft, by collecting and exposing the build
information in a single call.
